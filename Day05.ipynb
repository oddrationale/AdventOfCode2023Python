The destination range is the same length, but it starts at <code>50</code>, so its two values are <code>50</code> and <code>51</code>.

This corresponds to a destination range starting at <code>52</code> and also containing <code>48</code> values: <code>52</code>, <code>53</code>, ..., <code>98</code>, <code>99</code>.
