When you turn to warn the Elf, she disappears before your eyes! To be fair, she had just finished warning you about <em>ghosts</em> a few minutes ago.</p>\n",
        "<p>One of the camel's pouches is labeled \"maps\" - sure enough, it's full of documents (your puzzle input) about how to navigate the desert. At least, you're pretty sure that's what they are; one of the documents contains a list of left/right instructions, and the rest of the documents seem to describe some kind of <em>network</em> of labeled nodes.</p>\n",
        "<p>It seems like you're meant to use the <em>left/right</em> instructions to <em>navigate the network</em>. Perhaps if you have the camel follow the same instructions, you can escape the haunted wasteland!</p>\n",
        "<p>After examining the maps for a bit, two nodes stick out: <code>AAA</code> and <code>ZZZ</code>. You feel like <code>AAA</code> is where you are now, and you have to follow the left/right instructions until you reach <code>ZZZ</code>.</p>\n",
        "<p>This format defines each <em>node</em> of the network individually. For example:</p>\n",
        "<pre><code>RL\n",
        "\n",
        "AAA = (BBB, CCC)\n",
        "BBB = (DDD, EEE)\n",
        "CCC = (ZZZ, GGG)\n",
        "DDD = (DDD, DDD)\n",
        "EEE = (EEE, EEE)\n",
        "GGG = (GGG, GGG)\n",
        "ZZZ = (ZZZ, ZZZ)\n",
        "</code></pre>\n",
        "<p>Starting with <code>AAA</code>, you need to <em>look up the next element</em> based on the next left/right instruction in your input. In this example, start with <code>AAA</code> and go <em>right</em> (<code>R</code>) by choosing the right element of <code>AAA</code>, <code><em>CCC</em></code>. Then, <code>L</code> means to choose the <em>left</em> element of <code>CCC</code>, <code><em>ZZZ</em></code>. By following the left/right instructions, you reach <code>ZZZ</code> in <code><em>2</em></code> steps.</p>\n",
        "<p>Of course, you might not find <code>ZZZ</code> right away. If you run out of left/right instructions, repeat the whole sequence of instructions as necessary: <code>RL</code> really means <code>RLRLRLRLRLRLRLRL...</code> and so on. For example, here is a situation that takes <code><em>6</em></code> steps to reach <code>ZZZ</code>:</p>\n",
